    As the name suggests, TensorFlow is a procedure which makes tensors flow. The tensor, resembled as a multidimensional array, is a generalization of the vector (one dimensional) and the matrix (two dimensional), while the flows of tensors are based on the Dataflow Graph, also called the Computation Graph. A typical TensorFlow program consists of the following parts:

    1. Define a Dataflow Graph (usually called 'model' in deep learning), which consists of large numbers of variables (called 'undetermined parameters');
    2. Repeat the following steps:

    1. Convert the training data into tensors and input them into the Dataflow Graph for calculation (forward propagation);
    #. Evaluate the loss function and find its partial derivatives for each variable (backward propagation);
    #. Use gradient descent or other optimizers to update variables in order to reduce the value of the loss function (i.e. training parameters).
    
	After enough times (and time) for repetition in step 2, the loss function will decrease to a very small value, indicating the completion of the model training.

    Before elaborating a variety of concepts in TensorFlow such as Tensor, Dataflow Graph, Variable, Optimizer and so on, we give an example first in this handbook so as to provide readers an intuitive comprehension.

This chapter introduces basic operations in TensorFlow.

TensorFlow 1+1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TensorFlow can be simply regarded as a library of scientific calculation (resembled as Numpy in Python). Here we calculate :math:`1+1` and :math:`\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{bmatrix}` as our first example.

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/code/en/basic/eager/1plus1.py  

Output::
    
    tf.Tensor(2, shape=(), dtype=int32)
    tf.Tensor(
    [[19 22]
    [43 50]], shape=(2, 2), dtype=int32)

The code above declares four **tensors** named ``a``, ``b``, ``A`` and ``B``. It also invokes two **operations** ``tf.add()`` and ``tf.matmul()`` which respectively do addition and matrix multiplication with tensors. Operation results are immediately stored in the tensors ``c`` and ``C``. **Shape** and **dtype** are two major attributes of a tensor. Here ``a``, ``b`` and ``c`` are scalars with null shape and int32 dtype, while ``A``, ``B``, ``C`` are 2-by-2 matrices with ``(2, 2)`` shape and int32 dtype.

In machine learning, it's common to differentiate functions. TensorFlow provides the powerful **Automatic Differentiation Mechanism** for differentiation. The following codes show how to utilize ``tf.GradientTape()`` to get the slope of :math:`y(x) = x^2` at :math:`x = 3`.

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/code/en/basic/eager/grad.py  
    :lines: 1-8

Output::
    
    [array([9.], dtype=float32), array([6.], dtype=float32)]

Here ``x`` is a **variable** initialized to 3, declared by ``tf.get_variable()``. Like common tensors, variables also posses shape and dtype attributes, but require an initialization. We can indicate an initializer in ``tf.get_variable()`` by setting the ``Initializer`` parameter. Here we use ``tf.constant_initializer(3.)`` to initialize the variable ``x`` to ``3.`` with a float32 dtype. [#f0]_. An important difference between variables and common tensors is that a function can be differentiated by a variable instead of a tensor with the automatic differentiation mechanism by default. Therefore variables are usually used as parameters defined in machine learning models. ``tf.GraidentTape()`` is a recorder of automatic differentiation which records every variables and steps of calculation automatically. In the previous example, the variable ``x`` and the steps of the calculation ``y = tf.square(x)`` are recorded automatically, thus the derivative of the tensor ``y`` with respect to ``x`` can be obtained through ``y_grad = tape.gradient(y, x)``.

In machine learning, calculating the derivatives of a multivariable function, a vector or a matrix is a more common case, which is a piece cake for TensorFlow. The following codes show how to utilize ``tf.GradientTape()`` to differentiate :math:`L(w, b) = \|Xw + b - y\|^2` with respect to :math:`w` and :math:`b` at :math:`w = (1, 2)^T, b = 1`.

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/code/en/basic/eager/grad.py  
    :lines: 10-17

Output::

    [62.5, array([[35.],
       [50.]], dtype=float32), array([15.], dtype=float32)]

Here the operation ``tf.square()`` squares every element in the input tensor without altering their shapes while the operation ``tf.reduce_sum()`` outputs the sum of all elements in the input tensor with a null shape (the dimensions of the summation can be indicated by the ``axis`` parameter while all elements being summed up if not specified). TensorFlow contains a large number of tensor operation APIs including mathematical operations, tensor shape operations (like ``tf.reshape()``), slicing and concatenation (like ``tf.concat()``), etc. Check TensorFlow official API documentation [#f3]_ for further information.

As we can see from the output, TensorFlow helps us figure out that

.. math::

    L((1, 2)^T, 1) &= 62.5
    
    \frac{\partial L(w, b)}{\partial w} |_{w = (1, 2)^T, b = 1} &= \begin{bmatrix} 35 \\ 50\end{bmatrix}
    
    \frac{\partial L(w, b)}{\partial b} |_{w = (1, 2)^T, b = 1} &= 15

..
    By combining the automatic differentiation mechanism above with an **optimizer**, we can evaluate the extrema of a function. Here we use linear regression as an example (Evaluating :math:`\min_{w, b} L = (Xw + b - y)^2` essentially, :ref:`The next paragraph <linear-regression>` reveals the principles):

    .. literalinclude:: ../_static/code/en/basic/eager/regression.py  

.. _linear-regression:

A plain example: Linear regression
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's consider a practical problem. The house prices of a city between 2013 and 2017 are given by the following table:

======  =====  =====  =====  =====  =====
Year    2013   2014   2015   2016   2017
Price   12000  14000  15000  16500  17500
======  =====  =====  =====  =====  =====

Now we want to do linear regression with the given data, i.e. using the linear model :math:`y = ax + b` for fitting where ``a`` and ``b`` are undetermined parameters.

First, we define and normalize the data.

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/code/en/basic/example/numpy.py
    :lines: 1-7

Then, we use gradient descent to do linear regression which will find those two parameters ``a`` and ``b`` in the linear model [#f1]_.

Recalling from the fundamentals of machine learning that we know for finding the local minimum of a multivariable function :math:`f(x)` we use `gradient descent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent>`_ what does the following steps:

* Initialize the argument to :math:`x_0` and make :math:`k=0`
* Iterate the following steps repeatedly till the convergence criteria is met:

    * Find the gradient of the function :math:`f(x)` with respect to the parameter :math:`\nabla f(x_k)`
    * Update the parameter :math:`x_{k+1} = x_{k} - \gamma \nabla f(x_k)` where :math:`\gamma` is the learning rate (resembled as the step size of the gradient descent)
    * :math:`k \leftarrow k+1` 

Next we focus on implementing gradient descent by code in order to solve the linear regression :math:`\min_{a, b} L(a, b) = \sum_{i=1}^n(ax_i + b - y_i)^2`.

NumPy
-----------------------

The implementation of machine learning models is not a patent of TensorFlow. In fact, even most common scientific calculators or tools can solve simple models. This time we use Numpy, a general library of scientific computation, to implement gradient descent. Numpy supports multidimensional arrays to represent vectors, matrices and tensors with more dimensions. Meanwhile, it also supports lots of operations on multidimensional arrays (e.g. ``np.dot()`` calculates a inner products and ``np.sum()`` adds up all the elements). In this way Numpy is somewhat like MATLAB. In the following codes, we evaluate the partial derivatives of loss function with respect to the parameter ``a`` and ``b`` manually [#f2]_ then iterate by gradient descent to acquire the value of ``a`` and ``b`` eventually.

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/code/en/basic/example/numpy.py
    :lines: 9-

However, you may have noticed that there are several pain points using common libraries of scientific computation to implement machine learning models:

- It's often inevitable to differentiate functions manually. Simple ones may be fine, however the more complex ones (especially commonly appeared in deep learning models) are another story. Manual differentiation may be painful, even infeasible in the latter cases.
- It's also often inevitable to update parameters based on the gradients manually. Manual update is still easy here because the gradient descent is a rather basic method while it's not going to be easy anymore if we apply a more complex approach to update parameters (like Adam or Adagrad).

However, the appearance of TensorFlow eliminates these pain points to a large extent, granting users convenience for implementing machine learning models.

TensorFlow
--------------------------------------------------------

The **Eager Execution Mode** of TensorFlow [#f4]_ executes very similar operations with the above-mentioned Numpy while also provides a series of critical functions for deep learning such as faster operation speed (need support from GPU), automatic differentiation and optimizers, etc. We may notice that its code structure is similar to the one of Numpy. Here we delegates TensorFlow to do two important jobs:

* Using ``tape.gradient(ys, xs)`` to get the gradient automatically;
* Using ``optimizer.apply_gradients(grads_and_vars)`` to update parameters automatically.

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/code/en/basic/example/tensorflow_eager_autograd.py
    :lines: 12-29

Here we used the aforementioned approach to calculate the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to each parameter while we also used ``tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=1e-3)`` to declare an **optimizer** for graident descent with a learning rate of 1e-3. The optimizer can help us update parameters based on the result of differentiation in order to minimize a specific loss function by calling its ``apply_gradients()`` interface.

Note that for calling ``optimizer.apply_gradients()`` to update model parameters, we need to provide parameters ``grads_and_vars`` i.e. the variables to be updated (like ``variables`` in the aforementioned codes). To be specific, a Python list has to be passed, whose elements is a (partial derivative with respect to a variable, this variable) pair. For instance, ``[(grad_w, w), (grad_b, b)]`` is passed here. By executing ``grads = tape.gradient(loss, variables)`` we got partial derivatives of the loss function recorded in ``tape`` with respect to each variable. Then we use ``zip()`` in Python to pair the elements in ``grads = [grad_w, grad_b]`` and  ``vars = [w, b]`` together respectively so as to get the required parameter.

In application, we will usually adopt much more complex models instead of the linear model ``y_pred = tf.matmul(X, w) + b`` here which can be simply written in a single line. Therefore we will often write a model class and call it by ``y_pred = model(X)`` when needed. :doc:`The following chapter <models>` elaborates writing model classes.

    Chapter Summary
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. [#f0] We can add a decimal point after an integer to define it as a floating point number in Python. E.g. ``3.`` represent the floating point number ``3.0``.
.. [#f3] Mainly reference `Tensor Transformations <https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_guides/python/array_ops>`_ and `Math <https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_guides/python/math_ops>`_. Note that the tensor operation API of TensorFlow is very similar to Numpy, thus one can get started on TensorFlow rather quickly if knowing about the latter.
.. [#f1] In fact there is a analytic solution for the linear regression. We use gradient descent here just for showing you how TensorFlow works.
.. [#f2] The loss function here is its mean variance :math:`L(x) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^5 (ax_i + b - y_i)^2` whose partial derivatives with respect to ``a`` and ``b`` are :math:`\frac{\partial L}{\partial a} = \sum_{i=1}^5 (ax_i + b - y) x_i` and :math:`\frac{\partial L}{\partial b} = \sum_{i=1}^5 (ax_i + b - y)`.
.. [#f4] The opposite of Eager Execution is Graph Execution that TensorFlow adopts before version 1.8 in Mar 2018. This handbook is mainly written for fast iterative development, however the basic usage of the static Graph Execution is also attached in the appendices in case of need.
